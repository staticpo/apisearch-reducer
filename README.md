# API Search example & Reducer in js example

This project has two parts, one is a search exercise for the Star Wars characters API.
The other part involves creating a simple custom store.

This app was bootstrapped with `react-create-app` with a typescript template.

Info on the API used: [https://swapi.dev/documentation](https://swapi.dev/documentation)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

# Some considerations

Since this was a simple example, the implementation left out some things that would be present in a proper product ready for production deployment.

These are: testing, rate limiting and or debouncing for the search field, react-router for proper page support.
